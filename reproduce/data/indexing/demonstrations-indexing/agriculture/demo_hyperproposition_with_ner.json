        "passage": "One of the most challenging aspects of diversified market farming is keeping your crops healthy. There are two keys to this: First, when you grow a plant under optimum conditions, you are less likely to have problems with insects and diseases. Optimum conditions include choosing appropriate varieties, planting at the right time, planting into healthy soil, using the best spacing, keeping the young plants weed-free, and providing water and fertility as needed by the plant. There is ample scientific evidence that well-grown crops are less attractive to insect pests and more resistant to diseases.\n\nThe other key to insect and disease control is to know and understand the life cycles of each. This is a tall order, when you consider that you might grow 20, 40, or more different crops each year, and each crop has several insects and diseases that can harm it. It becomes even more complicated when you realize that beneficial insects, naturally occurring on your farm, are often the best solution to pest problems. As an ecological farmer, you must recognize the good guys, the bad guys, and when you can let the former take care of the latter and when you must get involved. Once you have determined that you have to take action to save a crop, you must know which methods and products are safest and most appropriate.\n\nMany gardeners assume there is some easy answer to every pest problem, and for those who are not interested in ecological farming, there probably is a broad-spectrum pesticide that will kill everything moving in the garden.",
