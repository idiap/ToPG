        "passage": "Biomarker testing Biomarkers are targetable features of a cancer. Many are mutations (changes) in the DNA of the cancer cells. For thyroid cancers with 1 or more specific biomarkers, targeted therapy or immunotherapy may be a treatment option if needed. Biomarker testing involves analyzing a piece of tumor tissue in a lab or testing a sample of blood. Testing for the following biomarkers is recommended for recurrent, advanced, or metastatic cancers that can't be treated with Radioactive Iodine therapy: h ALK gene fusion NTRK gene fusion BRAF gene mutations RET gene fusion (found in some medullary thyroid cancers) Mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) Tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) Your provider may test for these individually or as part of a group. Testing for many biomarkers at one time is called nextgeneration sequencing (NGS). Cancer that returns to the neck If the cancer can be removed based on its size and location, surgery is the preferred treatment. For cancers that take up iodine, treatment with Radioactive Iodine therapy will also be considered. But, treatment isn't always needed. If the cancer isn't getting worse and isn't close to any critical structures, your provider may recommend close monitoring instead of treatment. If the cancer can't be removed with surgery, doesn’t take up iodine, and is getting worse (progressing), treatment with radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or both may be an option. The preferred targeted therapy for cancer that can’t be removed with surgery and is progressing is lenvatinib (Lenvima).",

        "passage": "There are 3 main types of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes or B cells make antibodies. An antibody is a protein that specifically targets infections or cancer cells and recruits other parts of the immune system. T lymphocytes or T cells help fight infections, cancer, and control immune responses. Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor cells or virus-infected cells. Follicular lymphoma starts in mature B cells. Follicular lymphoma Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is a slow-dividing, slow-growing B-cell lymphoma that typically forms tumors in lymph nodes. However, Follicular lymphoma can form tumors in other parts of the body such as the bone marrow. This is called extranodal (outside of the lymph node) disease. Not everyone with Follicular lymphoma needs treatment right away. How does Follicular lymphoma develop? In lymph nodes, temporary germinal centers (GCs) form in response to an immune stressor such as infection or inflammation.",

        "passage": "Often, no further treatment is needed after a polypectomy. In other cases, surgery (resection) of a bigger piece of the colon is needed. This depends on: The size and shape of the polyp (pedunculated or sessile), The polypectomy results, and The results of testing the removed tissue. Before deciding whether resection is needed after a polypectomy, your doctor will review the results of testing with you and discuss your options. Invasive cancer For cancers not found early enough to be removed by polypectomy, colectomy (colon surgery) is needed. Surgery is only an option if the colon tumor can be completely removed. If you cannot have surgery first, see page Colectomy A colectomy is a surgery that removes the part of the colon with cancer. After the cancerous part is removed, the two healthy ends of the remaining colon are sewn or stapled together. At least 12 lymph nodes near the tumor will be removed and tested for cancer, in addition to any nodes that look abnormal to the surgeon. A colectomy can be done in two ways. The open method removes tumor tissue through a Colectomy Surgery for colon cancer is called colectomy. It involves removing the cancerous part of the colon.",
