Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph or any other provision of the Rules and Regulations to the contrary, Landlord hereby agrees that all such rules and regulations, and any changes thereto, shall be non-discriminatory in substance to the tenants of the Building. Landlord may, however, grant exceptions to the Rules and Regulations for particular tenants in particular instances without being deemed to be in violation of the immediately preceding sentence; provided, however, that: (A) if Landlord permanently excuses any other tenant of the Building from complying with any of the Rules and Regulations, then, until such time as such excuse ends, Tenant shall also not be obligated to comply with the applicable Rules and Regulations; and (B) Landlord shall not excuse any other tenant from complying with any Rule and Regulation if Landlord reasonably believes that such excuse will have a material adverse impact on Tenant’s use of the Leased Premises. In the event of a conflict between the Rules and Regulations and the provisions of this Lease, the provisions of this Lease shall govern and control.",
